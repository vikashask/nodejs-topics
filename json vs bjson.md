## JSON
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a light-weight data interchange format, which can get transferred from one system to the other easily. It is easy to read and write this format. It is also not a complex task for machines to parse and generate.

JSON will have two things- An object and an array. An object is a collection of name/value pairs and an array is an ordered list of values

So an object will start with curly braces and end with curly braces and then comes the key and value. An array will start with the normal, non-curly brackets, then comes value and comma.

## BSON
BSON is nothing but Binary JSON i.e Binary JavaScript Object Notation. Unlike JSON, it is not in a readable format. It supports the embedding of documents and arrays within other documents and arrays.
